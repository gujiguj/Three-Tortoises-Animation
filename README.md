# Three Tortoises Animation

A short 30s movie created using a canvas element and Three JS. The final animation can be accessed [here](https://gujiguj.github.io/Three-Tortoises-Animation/final.html).

Created (with much love and labor) for Villanova University CSC4300 Computer Graphics.
Instructions for completing the final project were posted [here](http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~mdamian/classes/csc4300/hw/final/final-instr.html).
